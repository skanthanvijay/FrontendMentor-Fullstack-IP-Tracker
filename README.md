- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- Node.js (Express)
- EJS
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- HTML/CSS

### What I learned

This was the first full stack application that I had programmed on my own. Through creating this project, I learned how to use environment variables in JavaScript to hide pieces of information from the client (such as the geolocator API key). I also learned how to get data from an API and store that data in a database.

### Continued development

I want to learn how to use ReactJS soon, as that will help a lot with creating frontend code that can be effectively used with backend applications.

### Useful resources

- [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp) - Using information I learned from the database and EJS sections of this course, I was able to make the application full stack as it is.
